🧠 Python Frameworks Assignment: CORD-19 Data Analysis & Streamlit App

Welcome to my Python Frameworks Assignment!
This repository showcases my work analyzing the CORD-19 research dataset, focusing on data exploration, visualization, and the creation of an interactive Streamlit web app for insight discovery.

Note: The full metadata.csv (CORD-19) file is not included in the repo due to its large size (~2GB).
A smaller metadata_sample.csv file has been generated and is used for the Streamlit demo.

🧾 1️⃣ Project Overview

This project explores the CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset) and demonstrates key data analysis and visualization techniques using Python frameworks.

Objectives

Load and explore real-world data

Clean and prepare large datasets efficiently

Visualize publication patterns and keyword trends

Build an interactive web app using Streamlit

🧹 2️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning
Steps Performed

Loaded a sample of 2,000 rows from the original dataset for performance efficiency

Cleaned missing values and standardized text columns

Converted publish_time to datetime format

Extracted publication year

Added a new column for abstract word counts

df["publish_time"] = pd.to_datetime(df["publish_time"], errors="coerce")
df["year"] = df["publish_time"].dt.year
df["abstract_word_count"] = df["abstract"].fillna("").apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))

📊 3️⃣ Data Analysis & Visualization
Key Analyses

Publications over time — trends in COVID-19 research activity

Top publishing journals — top 10 journals by publication count

Word cloud of titles — most frequent words in paper titles

Abstract length distribution — histogram showing paper length trends

Libraries Used

pandas → data cleaning & manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn → data visualization

wordcloud → keyword visualization

streamlit → interactive web interface

📈 Example Visualization:

Top 10 Journals Publishing COVID-19 Research (bar chart)

🌐 4️⃣ Streamlit Application

The Streamlit app provides an interactive dashboard to explore the dataset dynamically.

App Features

✅ Filter publications by year range
✅ View dynamic visualizations (time trends, top journals, word clouds)
✅ Explore sample data directly in the browser

Running Locally

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run meta.py

Cloud

💭 5️⃣ Challenges & Reflections
Challenges

Handling a large dataset (>1GB) that couldn’t be easily loaded on limited RAM

Managing Git and Streamlit Cloud storage constraints

Optimizing for performance while maintaining analytical depth

What I Learned

Practical data cleaning and visualization workflows

Integrating Python notebooks with Streamlit for web-based analysis

Efficient handling of real-world data at scale

Deployment of machine learning/data apps on cloud platforms

🙌 6️⃣ Credits

Dataset: CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset)

Frameworks: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, streamlit

Created by: Nomize 

🧭 Final Notes

The app is fully deployed and functional on Streamlit Cloud.

You can clone this repository, replace the sample dataset with your own, and run the analysis locally.

The analysis output varies depending on the selected publication year range — wider year spans yield richer visualizations.
